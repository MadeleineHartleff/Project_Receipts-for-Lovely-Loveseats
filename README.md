<ul>
  <li>Stores descriptions and prices of furniture items in variables.</li>
  <li>Calculates the total cost of purchased items.</li>
  <li>Applies a sales tax to the total.</li>
  <li>Prints an itemized receipt for the customer.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
This project is aimed at beginners to get hands-on experience with:

<ul>
  <li>Declaring and manipulating variables in Python.</li>
  <li>Performing basic arithmetic operations.</li>
  <li>Generating formatted strings to present a final receipt to customers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Credits</h2>
